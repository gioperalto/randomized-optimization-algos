# Randomized Optimization Assignment - Giovanni Peralto
Code was written in Python 3.x. Python/pip is needed to run the program.

### Instructions:

Install dependencies: 
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install numpy`
- `pip install scikit-learn`
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install mlrose`
- `pip install time`
- `pip install tqdm`

Create images directories:
- `mkdir images`
- `mkdir images/nn`
- `mkdir images/optimizatin-problems`
- `mkdir images/optimizatin-problems/4-peaks`
- `mkdir images/optimizatin-problems/10-queens`
- `mkdir images/optimizatin-problems/knapsack`

Run instructions:
- Knapsack: `python knapsack.py`
- Four Peaks: `python 4-peaks.py`
- 10-Queens: `python 10-queens.py`
- Neural Networks: `python nn.py` (takes a ~30m)
    - GA learning curve takes longest, if you comment it out everything else should run in ~15m
